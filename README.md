This is a record of my research on making an embedded device be recognized as an USB disk for other devices.

## Platform
- The Embedded Device
  * ~~Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B)~~
    [UPDATE: It can not be used. https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=15696]
  * Looking for a possible choice [EX: Raspberry Pi Zero]
